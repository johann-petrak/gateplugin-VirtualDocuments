# Build

Prerequesites: 

* GATE version 6 or later installed in `GATE_HOME `
* ant - as GATE comes with ant, you can use `GATE_HOME/ant` for this

All necessary libraries for building are already contained in the "lib" directory.

To build the plugin and create the JavaDoc just use the command ant. When the compile is successful, this will create the file VirtualDocuments.jar and the JavaDoc documentation files in directory doc/javadoc.
